    **** Boeing BACXXX 3D wing in wind tunnel with Spalart Allmaras **** 

    === Overview

    The simulation considers a Boeing BACXXX 3D wing in a free stream. Solution to the RANS equations with
    Spalart Allmaras closure is considered. The angle of attack is 0 degrees and the Reynolds number based on
    the root chord and the free stream is 280,000, comparable to a university tunnel with a small test article.

    The solution strategy consists in obtaining a potential flow solution first, followed by a solution to the
    Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations with the Spalart-Allmaras one-equation model. The RANS solution
    is steady and features resolved boundary layers. Wall functions are *not* used.

    The solution approach consists of 3 sequential steps

    1. snappyHexMesh is used to castellate, snap, and add layers
    2. potentialFoam is used to obtain a potential flow solution
    3. simpleFoam is used to solve the RANS equations, taking 2000 iterations to convergence to a solution

    As the simulation progresses, various diagnostics are ouputted to file, including the forces on the wing,
    the force coefficients, the residuals of the equations, and visualization files of plane cuts through
    the three-dimensional flow solution for all fields.

    The case can be run in parallel only due to the large number of cells.


    === Changing flow parameters 

      1. In order to change the angle of attack, change the variable

            rotAngle 0.0; // degrees
    
         in the file 0/include/inputs

         This will change the blockMeshDict as well as the inlet velocity vectors accordingly.

      2. In order to change the Reynolds number, change the variable

           reynoldsNr 295000.0;

         in the file 0/include/inputs

         which is then used to compute the kinematic viscosity where needed. 

  
    === Postprocessing

    Once data and results have been obtained, you can execute
  
        gnuplot residuals.plt 
        gnuplot forces.plt 
        gnuplot forceCoeffs.plt 

    to generate EPS files of the residuals, forces, and force coefficients as a function of the iteration number.

    Select EPS, and PDF figures are available in pics/
